It will take a lot more time to develop with Shadcn than with Material Template.
We would need to start debugging css related stuff and that is not the focus right now.

The problem of using the template is that we have a license agreement. For that reason, the project will need to continue as a private project for now, and that comes with more CI complexities (private repo, build costs, security, transfer pipeline to GCP, and so on).
