description: 'Graduate Pre-release to production tags with Lerna'

To make Lerna create a production tag after a prerelease, you can use the --conventional-graduate flag. This flag will cause Lerna to remove the pre-release information from previously created pre-release tags, and then create a production tag with that version number.

For example, if you run the following command:

```bash
lerna version prerelease --preid beta
```

The tag `my-app@0.37.4-beta.0` will be created and pushed to your repository.

Remember that this approach do not take into consideration weather the commit messages follow the conventional commits specification or not, so the first prerelease after a production release will always bump the patch version no matter if previous commits indicate that a new feature was added.

If you want your prerelease to be bumped according to the conventional commits specification, you can use the --conventional-prerelease flag instead as pointed out by Mizo [(Mizo, 2020)](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/issues/1433#issuecomment-623413942).

`lerna version --conventional-prerelease --preid beta`

According to Khandelwal, other strategies using preminor, premajor are also possible [(Khandelwal, 2021)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/lerna-from-devops-point-view-shishir-khandelwal).

After that, if you run the following command:

```bash
lerna version --conventional-graduate
```

Lerna will create the `my-app@0.37.4` tag. Note that it has the same version number as the `my-app@0.37.4-beta.0` tag, but without the pre-release information.

You can also use the --dist-tag flag to specify the name of the production tag. For example, the following command will create a production tag called production:

```bash
lerna version prerelease --preid beta
lerna version --conventional-graduate --dist-tag production
```

This will create the following tags:

```bash
my-app@0.37.4-beta.0
my-app@0.37.4
my-app@0.37.4#production
```

The `my-app@0.37.4#production` tag is the production tag.
