## GCP Resources

1. **google_compute_network**: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network, which is a virtual version of a traditional physical network. This is the first resource you need to create because all other resources will be connected to or associated with this network.
2. **google_vpc_access_connector**: Connects your Google Cloud Run service to the VPC network. It must be created after the VPC network and before the Cloud Run service.
3. **google_compute_global_address**: A global IP address that you reserve for your Google Cloud resources. It should be created after the VPC network and before the Cloud Router and Cloud NAT.
4. **google_service_networking_connection**: A peering connection that allows your VPC network to connect with Google-managed services (like Cloud SQL). It should be created after the VPC network and before the Cloud SQL instance.
5. **google_compute_router**: A virtual router within your VPC network. It's used to forward traffic between different subnets within your network. It should be created after the VPC network and global address, and before the Cloud NAT.
6. **google_compute_router_nat**: A Cloud NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway, which allows instances without external IP addresses to access the internet. It should be created after the VPC network, global address, and router.
7. **google_sql_database_instance**: Your Cloud SQL PostgreSQL database. It should be created after the VPC network and the service networking connection.
8. **google_cloud_run_service**: Your NestJS service deployed on Google Cloud Run. It should be created after the VPC network, VPC access connector, and Cloud SQL database instance.

## GCP Database Preview Environments with Clones

:::warning

In GCP, when you clone a database instance, you bring the data, the users, and the permissions from the source to the newly created instance. In this
case, if you try to replicate the environment by creating a database and user with the same name, you will get an error because they already exist.

We needed to take that into consideration (after making that mistake).

## Terraform modules and dynamic inputs

In commit "456e8bfdaf240e59af4ca8cb3c66488a1747877d", every code deploy resulted in the preview environment being fully recreated. This was not ideal
since was taking a lot of time for no apparent reason.

```tf
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
-/+ destroy and then create replacement
 <= read (data resources)
Terraform will perform the following actions:
  # module.staging.data.external.bash will be read during apply
  # (depends on a resource or a module with changes pending)
 <= data "external" "bash" {
      + id      = (known after apply)
      + program = [
          + "bash",
          + "-c",
          + "branch_name='staging'; environment_name=$(echo \"$branch_name\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g'); echo \"{\\\"environment_name\\\": \\\"$environment_name\\\"}\"",
        ]
      + result  = (known after apply)
    }
  # module.staging.module.postgresql_dbms.google_sql_database_instance.preview_environment[0] must be replaced
-/+ resource "google_sql_database_instance" "preview_environment" {
      ~ available_maintenance_versions = [] -> (known after apply)
      ~ connection_name                = "core-platform-shell-iac:europe-west3:core-platform-shell-iac-staging" -> (known after apply)
      + encryption_key_name            = (known after apply)
      ~ first_ip_address               = "<internal-ip-address-here>" -> (known after apply)
      ~ id                             = "core-platform-shell-iac-staging" -> (known after apply)
      ~ instance_type                  = "CLOUD_SQL_INSTANCE" -> (known after apply)
      ~ ip_address                     = [
          - {
              - ip_address     = "<internal-ip-address-here>"
              - time_to_retire = ""
              - type           = "PRIVATE"
            },
        ] -> (known after apply)
      ~ maintenance_version            = "POSTGRES_14_7.R20230530.01_04" -> (known after apply)
      + master_instance_name           = (known after apply)
      # Warning: this attribute value will no longer be marked as sensitive
      # after applying this change.
      ~ name                           = (sensitive value) # forces replacement
      ~ private_ip_address             = "<internal-ip-address-here>" -> (known after apply)
      + public_ip_address              = (known after apply)
```

The terraform logs suggests that it had something to do with "module.staging.data.external.bash" changing based on an input, but we were not sure what it is.
The first hypothesis that emerges is that the "branch_name" variable was changing, but we were not sure why. In order to evaluate that hypothesis
we set the "environment_name" straight as a hardcoded input, leaving notes for future reference.

The "environment" module was changed from this:

```t
output "branch_name" {
  value = var.branch_name
}

# Parse branch name to environment name
data "external" "bash" {
  program = ["bash", "-c", "branch_name='${var.branch_name}'; environment_name=$(echo \"$branch_name\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g'); echo \"{\\\"environment_name\\\": \\\"$environment_name\\\"}\""]
}

locals {
  environment_name = data.external.bash.result["environment_name"]
}
```

to this:

```t
output "branch_name" {
  value = var.branch_name
}

# Parse branch name to environment name
data "external" "bash" {
  program = ["bash", "-c", "branch_name='${var.branch_name}'; environment_name=$(echo \"$branch_name\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g'); echo \"{\\\"environment_name\\\": \\\"$environment_name\\\"}\""]
}

locals {
  # environment_name = data.external.bash.result["environment_name"]
  environment_name = var.environment_name
}
```

And the "staging" module now was called with the "environment_name" as a hardcoded value.

```t
# Staging Environment
module "staging" {
  source                              = "../../../libs/iac-modules/environment"
  branch_name                         = "staging"
  environment_name                    = "staging" # environment_name=$(echo "$branch_name" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g'). [hypothesis] Passing this value hardcoded here prevents the module from being destroyed and recreated unnecessarily. Take a look at the description of the environment_name variable in the environment module.
  source_environment_branch_name      = module.production.branch_name
  source_environment_dbms_instance_id = module.production.postgresql_dbms_instance_id
  short_commit_sha                    = var.short_commit_sha
  gcp_project_id                      = var.gcp_project_id
  gcp_location                        = var.gcp_location
  gcp_docker_artifact_repository_name = var.gcp_docker_artifact_repository_name
  depends_on                          = [module.gcp_apis, module.production]
}
```

After making this change, we tested the hypothesis by running a new terraform apply, expecting that the "module.staging.data.external.bash"
would still change, but the "module.staging.module.postgresql_dbms.google_sql_database_instance.preview_environment[0]" would not,
and that is exactly what happened.

While the result was what we expected, we still had to figure out how to pass the "environment_name" variable to the "environment"
module dynamically. Since we are still learning Terraform and do not quite understand its internals, the theory we came up with was
that the Terraform module assumes that a value cannot be predicted before a bash transformation within the module, and it assumes
that the value will change even if it is not the case. The hypothesis we decided to test now is that if the calculated value was passed
to the module after the transformation, than the module would not make that false guess since it would be receiving a known value.

The resulting "environment" module call was changed to:

```t
# Staging Environment

# Parse branch name to environment name
locals {
  staging_branch_name = "staging"
}
data "external" "staging_branch_name" {
  program = ["bash", "-c", "branch_name='${local.staging_branch_name}'; environment_name=$(echo \"$branch_name\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g'); echo \"{\\\"environment_name\\\": \\\"$environment_name\\\"}\""]
}

locals {
  environment_name = data.external.staging_branch_name.result["environment_name"]
}

module "staging" {
  source                              = "../../../libs/iac-modules/environment"
  branch_name                         = "staging"
  environment_name                    = local.staging_branch_name # environment_name=$(echo "$branch_name" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9]/-/g'). [hypothesis] Passing this value hardcoded here prevents the module from being destroyed and recreated unnecessarily. Take a look at the description of the environment_name variable in the environment module.
  source_environment_branch_name      = module.production.branch_name
  source_environment_dbms_instance_id = module.production.postgresql_dbms_instance_id
  short_commit_sha                    = var.short_commit_sha
  gcp_project_id                      = var.gcp_project_id
  gcp_location                        = var.gcp_location
  gcp_docker_artifact_repository_name = var.gcp_docker_artifact_repository_name
  depends_on                          = [module.gcp_apis, module.production]
}
```

And the terraform logs now show that changes in "environment_name" outside of the module are not affecting the module anymore. Now Instead of
25 resources being destroyed and recreated, only the expected 4 resources are being recreated.

Now we only needed to abstract that into it's own module in order to enhance the legibility of the main terraform file (the one that calls
the environment modules).

Unfortunately, after abstracting that into it's own module, the terraform logs showed that the modules went back to the state where they were
being destroyed and recreated. We then gave a step back and left it as it was before, with the "environment_name" being passed as a local
variable from the main root module. The module "environment-wrapper" that was created to abstract the parsing of "branch_name" to "environment_name"
was removed but is still available as archive for documentation purposes.
