## GitHub Actions

In the realm of CI/CD pipeline development, the comparison between GitHub Actions and GCP Cloud Build for building
and pushing Docker images presents an intriguing dichotomy. On one hand, GitHub Actions offers a streamlined, intuitive
approach that seamlessly integrates with the existing GitHub ecosystem. Its straightforward configuration and
robust functionality allow developers to focus on the core objective: delivering a high-quality product to the end-users.
The simplicity of GitHub Actions ensures that the focus remains on the product, rather than getting lost in the labyrinth
of configuration details.

## GCP Cloud Build

On the other hand, GCP Cloud Build, while powerful and flexible, can sometimes feel like a maze of configurations,
diverting attention from the primary goal of product delivery. The complexity of setting up the pipeline in GCP Cloud
Build can sometimes overshadow the actual purpose of the pipeline, which is to facilitate a smooth and efficient delivery
process. While we appreciate the capabilities of GCP Cloud Build, we believe that the ease of use and straightforwardness
of GitHub Actions better serve our current needs.

## Temporary Conclusion

Therefore, for now, we will stick to GitHub Actions for the build and push Docker images part. For now, I'll keep this post as that, as a reminder of when and why we took the GitHub Actions route. Eventually Its
might be updated to describe the process in more detail.
