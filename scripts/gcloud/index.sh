# This script creates the basic setup in GCP for running Terraform.
# It creates a project, a service account, and assigns the necessary roles to the service account.
# It also enables the APIs that are required for running Terraform.
# The script assumes that the user has already authenticated with gcloud CLI and set the default project with gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID.

# TODO: Add scripts after each comment

# Enable APIs
# Create Terraform Bucket
# Create Service Account
# Add IAM Policy Bindings
